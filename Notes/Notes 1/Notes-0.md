## A little bit of Ubuntu's background

### The Ubuntu vision
* In April 2004 Mark Shuttleworth brought together a group of developers from the Debian project, GNOME, and GNU. The goal of the meeting was to answer the following questions:
  * Is a batter type of operating system possible?
  * What would this OS look like?
  * Can you describe the community that would build this project?
  The team called itself the Warthogs and set on to build the Ubuntu operating system.
* Before Ubuntu, installing Linux was a project for computer enthusiasts. Linux on the desktop was considered a computer nerd only operating system because it was a difficult to install and maintain for a regular computer user.
* Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog), released on 20 October 2004. It was Canonical's first release of Ubuntu and it looked like this:

*Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake), released on 1 June 2006, was Canonical's fourth release and the first long-term support (LTS) release. It looked like this:

### Ubuntu flavors
An ubuntu flavor is an operating system based on ubuntu that uses a different desktop environment than the default Ubuntu's desktop environment (GNOME). Ubuntu flavors offer a unique way to experience Ubuntu, each with their own choice of default applications and settings. Ubuntu favors are backed by the full Ubuntu archive for packages and updates.
### Ubuntu has 7 official flavors:
