# Deliverable 2
* I will be using a few different websites and youtube videos that will help me create a Samba file server that I can access from both a linux and windows computer.
* https://www.process.st/checklist/linux-samba-file-server-setup-checklist/
* https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/samba-file-server
* I will be learning more about what the terminal can do and learn more about file sharing using samba.
* This will definitely help me out in the future to be able to setup and maintain file servers across multiple devices.
