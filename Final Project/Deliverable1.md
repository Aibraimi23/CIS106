1. I will be creating a file server with samba
2. I have chosen this project because i want to go into networking so i want to start with the basics.
3. Some roadblocks i might run into are finding the correct things to install and navigating paths.
4. I plan to do research and use every possible source of information to help me.
5. I think it will help me in my career because i am going into networking and file servers are apart of that and it will further my knowledge.
